# How to Choose a Side Hustle That Fits You

Most people skip this step—they chase trends instead of *fit*.  
The best side hustles aren’t random; they’re built at the intersection of **what you enjoy, what you’re good at, and what people value enough to pay for.**

This guide walks you through a short discovery process to find that intersection and finish with one promising idea worth testing.

## Step 1 — Define Your “Why”

Before picking what to do, decide **why** you want a side hustle.

Are you looking for…
- Extra income?
- Creative freedom?
- A path to full-time independence?
- Skills you can use at your day job?

Write your top 2–3 motivations in your notebook or the worksheet below.  
They’ll help you filter ideas later.

Your “why” will drive you when motivation dips. A clear purpose beats chasing a trendy niche every time.

## Step 2 — Inventory Your Strengths and Interests

List everything you’re reasonably good at *and* enjoy.  
Think: skills, hobbies, tools, or topics people already ask your help with.

Examples:
- “I’m good at explaining things” → tutoring, content, education
- “I like organizing” → virtual assistant work, Notion setups
- “I design graphics for fun” → branding, merch, social templates

Add these to the **Side Hustle Fit Worksheet** under “Strengths” and “Enjoyments.”  
Patterns will appear.

## Step 3 — Spot Problems People Actually Have

Now flip perspectives.  
Open your eyes to pain points around you—at work, in communities, or hobbies.

Look for phrases like:
- “I wish there were an easier way to…”
- “I’d pay someone to handle…”
- “This always takes forever…”

Spend 20 minutes listing problems. Don’t judge them yet.

Reddit threads, Facebook groups, subcultures, local businesses, and even your own frustrations are all gold mines.

## Step 4 — Cross the Three Circles

You now have three lists:
1. Things you **enjoy**
2. Things you **do well**
3. Problems people **want solved**

The overlap is your starting zone.

Use the worksheet to **score each idea** on:
- Enjoyment (1–5)
- Skill level (1–5)
- Market need (1–5)
- Time required
- Startup cost

Then rank the top 3 ideas with the highest total score.

## Step 5 — Reality-Test Your Top Pick

Pick your favorite idea and answer honestly:

| Question | Answer |
|-----------|---------|
| Who would I help? |  |
| What specific problem am I solving? |  |
| How could I test this idea in one weekend? |  |
| What would success look like after one month? |  |

If you can’t fill these in, the idea’s still fuzzy—go back and refine.

<TipBox title="Pro tip">
If you find yourself saying “anyone could use this,” you need to narrow down. Start with *someone*, not *everyone*.
</TipBox>

## Step 6 — Commit to One Experiment

Choose **one** idea and give it 30 days.  
That’s all. You’re not marrying it; you’re testing it.

Add the task to your calendar:  
> “Run first small test of [idea] between [dates].”
