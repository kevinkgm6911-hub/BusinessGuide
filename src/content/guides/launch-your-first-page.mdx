# Launch Your First Page (Your Simple Online Presence)

Your first “website” doesn’t need to be fancy.  
In fact, most side hustles only need **one clear page** to start getting attention and feedback.

This guide walks you through how to create that page — quickly, clearly, and without code.

## Step 1 — Pick a Platform You’ll Actually Use

Choose the simplest tool that fits your comfort level:

| Skill Level | Tool | Notes |
|--------------|------|-------|
| No tech experience | [Canva Websites](https://www.canva.com/websites/) | Free, drag-and-drop, great templates |
| Beginner | [Notion](https://notion.so) + [Super.so](https://super.so) | Clean, professional look |
| Intermediate | [Carrd](https://carrd.co) | Cheap custom domains + analytics |
| Confident / coder | [Framer](https://framer.com) or [Squarespace](https://squarespace.com) | Great visuals & scaling options |

Pick **one** and stick to it. You can always upgrade later.

If your goal is validation, speed beats perfection. You can’t learn from traffic you don’t have.

## Step 2 — Plan Your One-Page Structure

A good page answers these questions fast:
1. What do you do?  
2. Who is it for?  
3. What should visitors do next?

Here’s a simple structure you can copy:

[Headline] — “Helping [who] achieve [what] through [how].”

[Intro paragraph]
Explain what problem you solve and what makes you different.

[Offer or Services]
List 1–3 key things you provide.

[Social proof or preview]
Add an image, testimonial, or “see example” link.

[Call to Action]
Tell people what to do next — email you, sign up, or follow.


---

## Step 3 — Write Clear Copy

Keep your words short, conversational, and human.

Examples:
- ❌ “We deliver customized multi-platform solutions.”  
- ✅ “I help small creators launch online shops in a week.”

Your voice should match your brand tone from the previous guide.  
(If your tone was *friendly*, write like you’d text a friend. If *professional*, keep it simple and direct.)

<TipBox title="Copywriting shortcut">
Focus on **benefits** (“what they get”) instead of **features** (“what you do”).
</TipBox>

## Step 4 — Add a Visual Anchor

Use one high-quality image or illustration that fits your vibe:
- You working on your craft  
- A clean product photo  
- An abstract background that reflects your colors  

Free sites for visuals:
- [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com) — realistic photos  
- [Pexels](https://pexels.com) — lifestyle & creative shots  
- [Haikei](https://haikei.app) — background shapes  
- [LottieFiles](https://lottiefiles.com) — light animations  

If you’re using Canva or Carrd, match your **brand colors and fonts** from your identity sheet.

---

## Step 5 — Add Your Call to Action

Decide what you want visitors to do — then make that action obvious.

Common beginner CTAs:
- “Join my email list for updates”  
- “Book a free consultation”  
- “Follow my work on Instagram”  
- “Check out my first product”

<TipBox title="One CTA rule">
Keep just **one main call to action** on the page. More options = fewer clicks.
</TipBox>

---

## Step 6 — Go Live

- Connect your custom domain (optional but powerful)  
- Preview your site on both desktop and mobile  
- Share it in your Discord #showcase channel or on social media
