# Budgeting & Financial Setup for Beginners

Money stress kills more good ideas than failure ever does.  
That’s why it’s worth taking a few hours early on to build a simple, confident system — not a complex spreadsheet you’ll abandon.

This guide will help you:
1. Separate business and personal money  
2. Track what you earn and spend  
3. Plan for taxes, savings, and reinvestment

## Step 1 — Separate Your Money (Even If It’s Small)

If your side hustle income goes to your personal account, it’s impossible to know what’s *profit* and what’s *just spending money*.

**Do this first:**
- Open a separate checking account or digital wallet (even if it’s just a sub-account).  
- Send all income there and pay all business expenses from it.  
- If you ever pay personal bills from business funds, note them as “draw” or “owner pay.”

<TipBox title="Why this matters">
Separate accounts make your life easier at tax time and instantly clarify if you’re truly profitable.
</TipBox>

## Step 2 — List Your Starting Costs

Before you spend a dollar, estimate what you *need* to get going.  
Think of this as your **startup checklist**, not a shopping list.

Common beginner costs:
- Domain name or website tools  
- Software subscriptions  
- Product materials  
- Marketing or ads  
- Legal filings (LLC, DBA)  
- Bank or payment fees  

Keep your total under control — aim for **under $200** to start if possible.

## Step 3 — Create a Simple Tracking System

You don’t need accounting software yet.  
Start with a single **Budget Tracker** (see template below).

Track just three things:
1. Income (what came in)  
2. Expenses (what went out)  
3. Balance (what’s left)  

That’s enough to make smart decisions.

  note="Use in Excel or Google Sheets."

<TipBox title="Upgrade later">
If you start earning $1,000+ monthly, consider moving to Wave, QuickBooks, or Notion templates for better reporting.

## Step 4 — Set Up Your Savings & Tax Buckets

A simple rule:  
**Save 25% of every payment for taxes** (you’ll thank yourself later).

If possible:
- Open a separate “Tax” savings account  
- Transfer money weekly or after each payment  

Suggested split:
- 25% → Taxes  
- 10% → Reinvestment  
- 5% → Emergency cushion  
- The rest → Pay yourself or cover expenses  

Even small deposits create peace of mind.

## Step 5 — Track Weekly, Not Yearly

Once a week, review your tracker:
- Add new income or expenses  
- Check your balance  
- Update your savings or tax transfers  

Ten minutes a week prevents hours of chaos later.

Pick a ritual — Friday morning coffee or Sunday night review — and make it your standing “Money Check-In.”
</TipBox>
