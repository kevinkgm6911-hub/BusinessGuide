# Name, Brand & Simple Logo Design

Your brand starts the moment someone sees your project name or first image — long before they read what you do.  
That first impression shapes whether they trust you enough to look closer.

This guide helps you:
1. Choose a name that fits your voice  
2. Pick consistent visuals and tone  
3. Design a simple, professional logo

## Step 1 — Find a Name That Fits You

A good name should be **simple, memorable, and meaningful.**  
It doesn’t have to be clever — it has to be *clear*.

Ask yourself:
- What words describe your mission or vibe?  
- What emotion do you want people to feel?  
- Would you be proud to say it out loud?

Try mixing:
- **Concept + Outcome** → “GrowthGuide”, “CraftCoach”  
- **Descriptor + Personality** → “Honest Design”, “Bold Brew”  
- **Playful tweaks** → real words with new endings or combos  

<TipBox title="Quick filters">
If you can’t spell it or say it easily, skip it.  
If it sounds like a competitor, skip it.  
If you smile when you say it, keep it.
</TipBox>

When you have 3–5 options:
1. Check domain availability (`namecheap.com`, `vercel.domains`)  
2. Check Instagram & TikTok usernames  
3. Ask 3 friends which name sounds most “you”

## Step 2 — Pick Your Brand Personality

Every side hustle has a vibe. Write 3 adjectives that describe yours:  
> “Helpful, energetic, modern”  
> “Warm, trustworthy, creative”

Then pick your **tone of voice**:  
| Tone | Example Sentence |
|------|------------------|
| Friendly | “Let’s make this easy together.” |
| Professional | “Our process simplifies your workflow.” |
| Bold | “Stop overthinking — start building.” |

<TipBox title="Consistency tip">
Your tone should match your audience. A friendly tone works best for creators and freelancers; a confident tone fits services or B2B projects.
</TipBox>

## Step 3 — Choose Colors and Fonts

You don’t need a design degree to look cohesive — just a clear palette.

**Color Rule:**  
- 1 primary color (your accent)  
- 1 neutral background color  
- 1 optional secondary highlight  

Tools:
- [Coolors.co](https://coolors.co) → auto-generate palettes  
- [Khroma.co](https://khroma.co) → font + color matching  
- [BrandColors.net](https://brandcolors.net) → see real examples  

**Font Pairing:**  
Use one clean headline font + one readable body font.  
Try Google Fonts:  
- Headline → *Poppins*, *Raleway*, or *League Spartan*  
- Body → *Inter*, *Open Sans*, or *Source Sans Pro*

## Step 4 — Create a Simple Logo

You can make a great logo in 30 minutes with free tools.

**Tools to try:**
- [Canva Logo Maker](https://www.canva.com/logos/)
- [Looka](https://looka.com)
- [Hatchful by Shopify](https://hatchful.shopify.com)

Guidelines:
- Avoid more than 2 colors  
- Test it on light & dark backgrounds  
- Save in transparent PNG + SVG if possible  

<TipBox title="Pro tip">
Your logo’s job is recognition, not decoration.  
Start with clean text and one icon — you can always upgrade later.
</TipBox>

## Step 5 — Create Your Brand Identity Sheet

Bring everything together in one page:
- Logo (main + icon version)  
- Color palette (with hex codes)  
- Fonts (headline + body)  
- Tone of voice / adjectives  
- Example social post or cover image
