# Validate Your Idea in 48 Hours

Don’t guess. **Validate.** This guide gives you a practical, two-day plan to test whether your idea solves a real problem for real people.

**You’ll do four things:**
1) Define a clear hypothesis  
2) Talk to 5–10 potential customers  
3) Run a simple **landing-page smoke test**  
4) Decide: proceed, iterate, or pivot

## What “validation” actually means

Validation doesn’t mean “everyone loves it.”  
It means you have **evidence** that people experience the problem, your solution makes sense, and at least some are willing to **sign up, schedule, or pay** soon.

<TipBox title="Evidence to look for">
Screenshots of messages, interview notes, email signups, preorders, deposits, scheduled calls, waitlist opt-ins, or payments. Hype alone isn’t evidence.
</TipBox>

## Day 1 — Morning (1–2 hours): Write your hypothesis

A good hypothesis is specific and testable:

> **For:** [who] with [problem]  
> **We offer:** [solution promise]  
> **We’ll know it’s working when:** [metric/threshold]

**Example:**
> For new freelancers who struggle to price projects,  
> we offer a mini-toolkit + 30-min call that sets a price today.  
> We’ll know it’s working when **10 people** join the waitlist in 48 hours.

**Set a success threshold** now (e.g., 10 signups or 3 paid preorders).

---

## Day 1 — Midday (2–3 hours): Talk to 5–10 people

Use problem-first interviews (no pitching for the first 80%).  
Your job is to learn vocabulary, pains, and what they already tried.

<DownloadCard
  title="Customer Interview Script"
  description="Short prompts that keep you problem-focused and avoid leading questions."
  file="/downloads/idea-interview-script.pdf"
  note="Keep interviews to ~15 minutes. Take notes verbatim."
/>

**Ask:**
- “Tell me about the last time this was painful.”  
- “What have you tried? What was missing?”  
- “If a solution existed, what would make it a no-brainer?”  
- “Would you be open to trying something this week?”

<TipBox title="Signals to note">
Recurring phrases, workarounds, spreadsheets, subscriptions they already pay for, time lost, money lost, and moments of frustration.
</TipBox>

## Day 1 — Afternoon (2–3 hours): Build a smoke test

Create a **one-page landing** that promises the **outcome**. Add a clear CTA (email waitlist, book a call, or pay deposit).

<DownloadCard
  title="Landing Page Smoke Test Template"
  description="A minimal template with headline → problem → promise → proof → CTA. Includes HTML + a simple Netlify form."
  file="/downloads/landing-smoketest.zip"
  note="Hook the button to your waitlist form or Calendly."
/>

**What to include:**
- Headline with outcome (“Get your first 5 paid clients in 30 days”)  
- Pain points you heard in interviews  
- What you’ll deliver (bullets)  
- Simple proof (1 quote or before/after)  
- One CTA (join waitlist / book call / $X deposit)

---

## Day 2 — Morning (1–2 hours): Put it in front of people

Lightweight channels are fine:
- DM the **exact people** you interviewed (ask permission to share)  
- Post in 1–2 relevant forums/Discords/FB groups (follow rules)  
- Email 10 friends/colleagues who match your audience  
- Share on your personal socials (clear, specific)

**Keep score** (next section).

---

## Day 2 — Afternoon: Measure, learn, decide

Track results against your hypothesis threshold:

| Metric | What “good” looks like (example) |
|---|---|
| Click-through rate (DMs/socials) | 5–15% |
| Landing page conversion (to email / call) | 10–30% |
| Call bookings | 2–5 in 48h |
| Preorders / deposits | Any is strong; 3+ is great |

<TipBox title="It’s okay if it’s small">
A handful of qualified signups beats 500 random likes. You’re testing signal, not chasing virality.
</TipBox>

---

## Decision time

- **Proceed** if you hit or nearly hit your threshold and can talk to 3+ qualified leads.  
- **Iterate** if people engage but stall at the CTA—your promise or price may be off.  
- **Pivot** if you got crickets *and* interviews didn’t reveal pain.

**Write down** what you’ll change next (audience, promise, price, channel).

---

## Optional — Concierge MVP (bonus)

If 2–3 people are ready **now**, run a **concierge MVP** for one week:  
deliver the outcome manually (no code), charge a small fee, and learn like crazy.

- Scope: very specific outcome  
- Price: fair for your effort (e.g., $49–$199)  
- Goal: learn the steps you’d later automate or productize
