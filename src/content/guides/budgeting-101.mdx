# Budgeting for Beginners

You donâ€™t need an accounting degree to understand your money.  
You just need a clear, simple system â€” and the discipline to use it regularly.

This guide walks you through how to:
1. Separate personal and business finances  
2. Build a practical budget that fits your life  
3. Use your first **budget tracker template**

## Step 1 â€” Separate Your Accounts

If your personal and business money live in the same account, itâ€™s nearly impossible to track where itâ€™s all going.

Open a dedicated **checking account** (many banks offer free business accounts).  
If thatâ€™s not possible yet, use one personal account *exclusively* for business transactions.

<TipBox title="Why it matters">
Separating accounts makes bookkeeping easier and protects you if you ever get audited. It also helps you understand your *real* profit, not just whatâ€™s left in your main account.
</TipBox>

## Step 2 â€” Categorize Your Spending

Before you track anything, define a few **key categories**.  
Start small â€” you can always refine later.

Hereâ€™s a good starter list:

- Income  
- Business supplies & tools  
- Marketing & subscriptions  
- Travel or delivery costs  
- Taxes / savings  
- Personal expenses (optional)

<TipBox>
Keep categories broad. Fewer categories make your data easier to read and your habits easier to notice.

## Step 3 â€” Use the Template

Grab the free spreadsheet below. It auto-calculates totals and shows how much youâ€™re earning vs. spending each month.

  note="Prefer Notion? A copy link version is coming soon."
/>

Once downloaded:
1. Enter your starting balance  
2. Add each expense or income as it happens  
3. Use color coding to flag large or recurring costs

Youâ€™ll instantly see whether your side hustle is growing, breaking even, or eating into savings.

    { id: "review",label: "Set a recurring 10-minute weekly review" }

## Step 4 â€” Schedule a Weekly Review

Your budget only works if you *touch it often*.  
Spend **10 minutes each week** reviewing:

- Any new income or expenses  
- Whether you stayed under your target spending  
- What your current cash flow looks like

<TipBox title="Make it a ritual">
Set a reminder every Sunday evening or Monday morning. Treat it like brushing your teeth â€” a quick habit that saves you pain later.
</TipBox>

## Step 5 â€” Look for Patterns

After a month or two, youâ€™ll start seeing trends:
- Are there subscriptions you barely use?  
- Which categories take the biggest bite?  
- Is revenue consistent, or seasonal?

The point isnâ€™t perfection â€” itâ€™s awareness.  
Once you *see* where your money goes, better decisions follow naturally.
